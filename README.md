# Calculator
A calculator addon for the Elder Scrolls Online

###### Compatible with Elsweyr

Its used in the chat box and also has a clickable UI.

This addon is dependent on [LibAddonMenu-2.0](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info7-LibAddonMenu.html), so you will need to install that library and place it in your addon libraries folder if you do not already have that installed.  If you do have it installed already, no action is needed.

Read the Read.me for instructions on its uses.

Here is a link to where you can download the addon and look at some pictures of its output:

If you download the addon from here be sure to remove the README.md file and it's important to change the name from Calculator-master to Calculator. Otherwise it will not work when grabbed from here.
